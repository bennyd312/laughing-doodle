1
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,165
Ser Ryam was an excellent Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

2
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,815
But he was sick. I hope he died in peace.

3
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,699
Yes, your grace. He died in his sleep.

4
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:15,015
The Silent Sisters prepare their remains.

5
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:19,265
His successor, Ser Harrold, would like to meet

6
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,132
A replacement for Ser Ryam in the Guard.

7
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,749
Your grace, my lords.

8
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:28,115
The Kingsguard needs to find its seventh member.

9
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:33,500
With the help of the Hand of the King, I invited candidates to court.

10
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,132
They all gave an excellent proof of themselves.

11
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:40,515
Four ships lost!

12
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,449
One carried my flag.

13
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:45,582
The Stepstones are on fire,

14
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,649
And you stand here babbling.

15
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,699
If you want to talk about it...

16
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,832
I worry about the future

17
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,615
Of my ships and my men.

18
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:56,699
The Crown will compensate you and make you an offer

19
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:57,999
The families.

20
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,815
I don't want to be compensated.

21
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:06,099
I want to take control of the Stepstones by force, and chase away the crab chow.

22
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:09,249
I will not go to war with the Free Cities.

23
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,582
These pirates are not part of it.

24
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,682
Who do you think provides them with ships and supplies?

25
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:16,749
Throughout its history,

26
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:20,215
The Seven Kingdoms never fought the Free Cities.

27
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,932
If that happen,

28
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:24,048
The losses would be immense.

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,849
Why does crab feeding fear us?

30
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:37,582
The king's brother has taken Dragonstone and protects it

31
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,132
With their golden robes.

32
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:40,165
Daemon planted himself there

33
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:41,965
For more than six months.

34
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,815
And the crown doesn't lift an eyelash.

35
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:46,149
Be careful, Lord Corlys.

36
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:50,048
A seat at the king's table doesn't make him like you.

37
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:54,649
I do what I could do,

38
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:57,965
And sent emissaries to Pentos

39
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:00,798
And to Volantis to find common cause.

40
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,148
Ships and men will be mobilized.

41
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,932
The Stepstones issue will be resolved..

42
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:08,265
In due time.

43
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:10,549
You have dragon riders, father.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,265
Envy us.

45
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,715
The matter is not so simple, Rhaenyra.

46
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,249
It would be a show of force.

47
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,799
At least the princess has a plan.

48
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:34,415
I'm just saying that we should...

49
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,965
It might be ...

50
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:38,782
We could make the most of it

51
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,599
Of the resources the princess talks about.

52
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,515
Take her to see the Lord Commander candidates.

53
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:49,565
Good idea, your grace.

54
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:52,382
this knight

55
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,982
It will also ensure your protection. Then you must choose it.

56
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,232
Sor Desmond Caron.

57
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,532
A skilled knight, princess.

58
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,065
Please go ahead.

59
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,015
Son of Ser Royce Caron, Ser Desmond proved his strength

60
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,532
In and out of tournaments.

61
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,582
He recently crossed the Bosco del Re

62
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,615
And delivered a hunter

63
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,682
the Justice.

64
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,915
Thank him for his faithful service.

65
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,749
Thank you for your loyal service to the Crown, ser.

66
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,782
Sor Rymun Mallister

67
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,882
Son of Lord Lymond Mallister of Seagard.

68
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,649
Cider scrum winner.

69
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,732
Last left in the saddle.. of 23 riders.

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,782
Rider since the age of 18.

71
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,999
How many of these knights have battle experience?

72
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,149
Excluding hunters.

73
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,865
Sor Criston Cole.

74
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,215
the attendant's son

75
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:43,799
From the Lord of Blackhaven.

76
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,049
Welcome, Ser Criston.

77
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:51,399
Did you fight in the stormlands?

78
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,465
In the Lowlands of Dorne, princess.

79
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:56,799
A year of infantry to repel the Dornishmen.

80
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,882
Ser Dondarrion knighted me after a success in the Bones.

81
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,682
I choose to be Criston Cole.

82
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:12,132
Let's not make a hasty decision, princess.

83
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:16,715
Ser Criston is undoubtedly a valiant warrior,

84
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:21,265
But the Crakehalls and Mallisters are important allies of the Crown.

85
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:25,515
Seagart, for example, is our main protection against the Iron Islands.

86
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:27,132
These men are tournament drivers.

87
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,965
My father needs a man who fought the battle to protect him.

88
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,299
Do not you think?

89
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,615
That's right, princess.

90
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:38,615
So let's get ready

91
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:40,699
For the investiture of Ser Criston.

92
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,182
The capital of Valyria was built on a volcano,

93
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,699
Just like Dragonstone.

94
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:56,299
The dragon lords, flower of nobility,

95
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,265
They lived here, next to a volcano.

96
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:02,682
Close to the source of your magic and power.

97
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,465
There was Anogrion.

98
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,065
Blood mages practiced their art there.

99
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,215
What you've built... is wonderful.

100
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:18,832
Oh, I only study history and I provide the plans for the crown.

101
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,365
Masons build the buildings.

102
00:08:21,883 --> 00:08:24,298
Will Westeros become another Valyria?

103
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:25,465
It depends

104
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:29,082
Whether you talk about the empire during its heyday..or its downfall.

105
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,449
A thousand dragons, a fleet that covered

106
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,215
All the seas of the world.

107
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:40,899
Valyria's glory will never be equaled.

108
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:42,449
To the Seven Underworlds!

109
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,765
- How's it going with Rhaenyra? - What do you mean?

110
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,615
These days, he barely talks to me.

111
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,449
It might be hard for her

112
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,565
Unburden your heart.

113
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,182
Just need time.

114
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,032
I needed it when my mother died.

115
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,332
I wish it would come to me and...

116
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:27,615
Why not the other way around?

117
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,499
Sometimes I'd rather face the Dark Terror

118
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:33,049
Than my fifteen-year-old daughter.

119
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,332
I think she would trust you if you asked her.

120
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:42,432
You are so good to hear, Your Grace.

121
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,215
Rhaenyra doesn't know anything about our conversation, does she?

122
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:53,849
I mean ...

123
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,165
I don't think he would understand.

124
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:59,215
No, your grace.

125
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,799
It's been 6 months since my mother died,

126
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:19,015
And they already want my father to marry and find another heir.

127
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:20,549
I know these men

128
00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:24,449
They were secretly plotting when I was sent away.

129
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:28,032
Don't worry about lord and king's business.

130
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,649
Let's say your father remarried...

131
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,699
Your father loves you.

132
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,982
He chose you as his heir.

133
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,565
He didn't choose me... he rejected Daemon.

134
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,515
Kneel with me.

135
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,882
It's the only way I can be with my mother.

136
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,199
In the silence of the Temple of the Seven,

137
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:37,282
I feel close to her.

138
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,415
It's stupid, I know.

139
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,482
I don't think it's stupid.

140
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:47,815
No way.

141
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:49,049
Everything is fine.

142
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,732
You could try.

143
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:00,615
If you don't do it for me, do it for them.

144
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:26,732
What should I speak?

145
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,015
Anything you want.

146
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,815
It's between the gods and you.

147
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:08,765
I want you to see me as something other than your daughter.

148
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:14,615
Even my father doesn't understand us, women.

149
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:20,232
When I want to talk to him,

150
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,315
I always have to take the first step.

151
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:27,948
Thanks.

152
00:13:39,716 --> 00:13:42,799
Your grace, thank you for coming.

153
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,082
I know tempers are on fire today.

154
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,982
I attach great importance to the bond that unites our homes.

155
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,782
Rhaenys is my favorite cousin.

156
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,615
I want to apologize

157
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,982
For the remarks made during the restricted council.

158
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:00,065
I didn't mean to offend you.

159
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:04,782
Your fleet is an important asset to the kingdom.

160
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,982
But you understand that my duty as king..

161
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:11,299
It is to avoid war as long as possible.

162
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:13,899
Nobody wants open war.

163
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,282
May I speak sincerely, Your Grace?

164
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:21,649
I appreciate the candor of my advisors.

165
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,999
I fear the enemy's eyes

166
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,599
They are currently fixed in the Red Keep.

167
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,399
The queen is dead.

168
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,065
A woman was named heir for the first time.

169
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,899
The king's brother took over Dragonstone

170
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,715
Without any opposition.

171
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:43,349
And a foreign power is occupying our main sea lane.

172
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,749
This is a very sad image of my kingdom.

173
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,765
It's the harsh reality

174
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:50,049
Prima.

175
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:53,965
The Crown is seen as vulnerable.

176
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:57,132
And a blind foray into the Steps..

177
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:58,665
Would it prove otherwise?

178
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,732
To ride a storm,

179
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:03,865
Either we run towards it, or we go around it.

180
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,465
But we never wait for their attacks.

181
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:10,382
What conduct do you propose to adopt,

182
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,165
my Lord?

183
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:16,082
We unite our families.

184
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:18,415
Marry our daughter, Laena.

185
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:21,582
Let's unite the two great houses of Valyria.

186
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,715
Binding your dragons to our fleet with blood,

187
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:28,865
You will determine that the glory of your kingdom is in the days to come,

188
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:30,698
Not in the past.

189
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,415
I have to recognize..

190
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,549
That I had never thought about getting married again.

191
00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:41,865
Aemma died just 6 months ago.

192
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,215
Sooner or later you will have to find a new wife, Your Grace, the realm expects that.

193
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,615
To strengthen your lineage and produce heirs.

194
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,982
There is no better person than Laena.

195
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,815
we talked a little

196
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,215
Since when ...

197
00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:29,182
Much to my regret.

198
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,099
We must be free to speak openly.

199
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:35,649
You are free to speak whenever you want,

200
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,499
You are the king.

201
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,082
I loved your mother..

202
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,165
With all my heart.

203
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:53,815
Me too.

204
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,282
Ser Harrold has gathered brave knights.

205
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,415
But I talked to them

206
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:20,315
And Ser Criston is the only one who has ever really fought in battle.

207
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:24,232
He will shine in the Kingsguard.

208
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,532
During the little council...

209
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,099
Don't think about it anymore.

210
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,699
- I thought I might... - You're young.

211
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:38,299
You will learn.

212
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:05,665
This is our best chance to save your finger, Sire.

213
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:10,099
The worms will remove the necrotic flesh

214
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:12,182
And rot.

215
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:20,999
I just granted Lord Corlys an audience

216
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,032
E para Rhaenys.

217
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,415
Very kind of you.

218
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,015
Lord Corlys must have appreciated this gesture of mine.

219
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,849
He proposed a marriage to me.

220
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:32,949
With whom, Your Grace?

221
00:18:33,716 --> 00:18:35,265
Miss Leana.

222
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,065
To join the forces of our homes

223
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:41,199
And establish that the glory of my kingdom is yet to come,

224
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:42,515
And it still hasn't passed.

225
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,865
It was presumptuous on the part of Lord Corlys, Your Grace.

226
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,199
This matter should be discussed

227
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:48,782
To the restricted council.

228
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:51,332
That's what I'm doing.

229
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:54,015
Then ..

230
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,815
What do you advise me, my dear Otto?

231
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,132
Mrs Leana

232
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:02,232
She is very young, Your Grace.

233
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:07,432
True, but the problems that arose in the Grand Council remain.

234
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,015
marry their daughter

235
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:12,115
It would help a lot to resolve the outstanding issues.

236
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,732
And the alliance of two great houses

237
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:17,815
It would be a sign of unity

238
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:20,499
To the kingdom.. and beyond.

239
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,465
The Grand Master's argument is valid.

240
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,599
- But I fear Rhaenyra's reaction. - Why, my lord?

241
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:30,682
Your mother died.

242
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:33,332
Your father has to take care of the succession, that's normal.

243
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,032
Myself...

244
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:44,399
I loved my wife deeply.

245
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:48,299
The pain of his death still haunts me.

246
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,415
Being forced to remarry

247
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,482
to replace you

248
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,532
In the name of duty...

249
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,365
you are the king,

250
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,299
But I don't envy you..

251
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,365
How was the Black Terror?

252
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,482
You were the last to ride Balerion.

253
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,582
Just for a short time, before dying.

254
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,715
Its extinction marked the end of ancient Valyria.

255
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:44,249
Vhagar is still alive.

256
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:46,049
Somewhere ..

257
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,332
It's too big for the Dragon Pit.

258
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:51,215
Some would say it's too big even for our world.

259
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,049
Do you know where he nestled?

260
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,799
What you mean to say?

261
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,132
Do you know where Vhagar is now?

262
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:02,032
According to the dragon guardians, it should be somewhere on the shores of the Narrow Sea.

263
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:05,382
In the Port of Ibben, we sometimes hear his song..

264
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,749
They say it's sad.

265
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,399
Loneliness also affects dragons.

266
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,449
It would be an honor for me,

267
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,165
Unite our houses as in the times of ancient Valyria.

268
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,299
I will have children of pure Valyrian blood

269
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,915
To strengthen the royal bloodline, and with it the kingdom.

270
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:33,249
These are your father's words.

271
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,449
What did your mother tell you?

272
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,865
That I wouldn't sleep with you until I was 14.

273
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:12,132
It bothers you, right?

274
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:19,649
My father is the King.

275
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,015
He must remarry and strengthen the bloodline.

276
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:25,599
I asked if you mind.

277
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:28,815
Laena is your daughter. Does that bother you?

278
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,349
Clear.

279
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:36,015
But I understand the order of things.

280
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,615
I doubt this is your case.

281
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,565
If your intention was to arouse my anger,

282
00:22:45,816 --> 00:22:48,415
Know that you have failed, princess.

283
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:50,732
On the contrary.

284
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:54,832
let it be my daughter

285
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,249
or someone else, your father will have a new wife.

286
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:01,815
will generate new heirs

287
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,965
And one of them will inevitably be a boy.

288
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:07,282
When he comes of age,

289
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:11,465
You will be considered the heir to the throne, not you.

290
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,115
Because that's the order of things.

291
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,499
Once queen, I will disturb you.

292
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,132
I wish it were possible.

293
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:29,315
But the kingdom could have appointed a queen to the Great Council of Harrenhal.

294
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:30,832
He rejected the idea.

295
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:34,215
They rejected you, Princess Rhaenys

296
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,799
"The Queen Who Wasn't"

297
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,899
Not the idea of ​​a female queen, in fact those same men bowed to me.

298
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:42,732
And do you remember them bringing them the wine?

299
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:52,115
Here's the hard truth that no one dared to tell you.

300
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,999
Men would give fire and blood to the kingdom

301
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:59,382
Instead of seeing a woman rule.

302
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,132
Your father is not naive.

303
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:22,732
The Select Council urges me to remarry.

304
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,382
The kingdom asks for a new queen.

305
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:35,699
A kind and generous queen will reassure her subjects.

306
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:43,499
The select council suggested a name

307
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,365
Lady Corlys

308
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:50,015
He offered me his daughter's hand.

309
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,099
Miss Leana.

310
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:54,932
An excellent choice, Your Grace.

311
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,165
I confess I don't know her very well.

312
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,032
She is undoubtedly sweet and generous.

313
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,649
He will enjoy your company, as I will.

314
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,099
I brought a gift.

315
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,615
I asked for it to be fixed.

316
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:49,782
Your ..

317
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,182
A nice gesture from you, Alicent.

318
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:57,865
Very kind.

319
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:07,249
In between.

320
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:12,132
The King's Hand, Your Grace.

321
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,499
I urgently convened the little council.

322
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,049
For what reason?

323
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,332
You better see it directly.

324
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:26,949
Great.

325
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,700
{\an8}It was when the night was dark, at the time of the bat.

326
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,500
{\an8}The thief escaped our pursuit.

327
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,000
{\an8}How did you manage to steal a dragon egg

328
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,000
{\an8}under the eyes of 50 guards?

329
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,500
{\an8}It was Prince Daemon who took it, Lord.

330
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,132
The prince

331
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,499
He left a missive that contains

332
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,782
One explanation.

333
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,832
"It is with pleasure

334
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,399
That I, Daemon Targaryen,

335
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,199
Prince of Dragonstone and rightful heir

336
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:10,549
From the Iron Throne,

337
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:13,132
I inform you that I am about to have a second wife,

338
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,965
As in the days of ancient Valyria.

339
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:17,782
will take the title

340
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:20,915
From Lady Mysaria of Dragonstone.

341
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,299
Your Grace is pregnant. Also, a dragon egg

342
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,165
Will be placed in the crib, as tradition dictates

343
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,982
From House Targaryen. "

344
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,015
The prince

345
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:34,849
He invited you to his wedding, sir.

346
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:36,699
In two days.

347
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,999
Gods have mercy.

348
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,065
Who is this lady Mysaria?

349
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,615
- We think it's... - You whore.

350
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:46,799
This is an act of sedition.

351
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,099
I agree.

352
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,865
My brother

353
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,682
Try to provoke me.

354
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,765
He waits for my reaction.

355
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:55,115
The kingdom is watching, sir.

356
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:56,632
What should I do?

357
00:27:56,983 --> 00:27:58,532
Send him to the Wall?

358
00:27:59,316 --> 00:28:01,382
Stick your head on a pike?

359
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:05,699
Daemon conquered Deago Rock, surrounded by his golden cloaks

360
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:08,282
And stole a scary weapon.

361
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900
{\an8}What egg did Daemon steal?

362
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,900
{\an8}o of Dreamfyre, princess.

363
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,400
{\an8}the one you chose for Prince Baelon's birthplace.

364
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:36,449
Collect a supply, Otto.

365
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:39,499
I'm going to Dragonstone.

366
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:41,832
- I'll bring Daemon back. - Your grace.

367
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:46,799
Sorry, I can't agree with that. It's very dangerous.

368
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,599
Daemon is out of control.

369
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:51,732
Let me go to Dragonstone.

370
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,732
You are absolutely sublime.

371
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:23,099
Why are you pampering yourself like this?

372
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:30,932
Do you see the king tonight?

373
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:35,299
If yes you want.

374
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,765
- Good morning, Ser Criston. - My lady.

375
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:44,082
I've gathered your top 20 guards, Lord Main.

376
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,398
Ser Harrold will accompany us.

377
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:52,615
Take care of the Hand, Ser Criston.

378
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:12,665
Welcome to Dragonstone, Otto.

379
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,315
Your stay on this island is about to end.

380
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:21,749
Return the dragon egg, dismiss your army,

381
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:23,582
banish your whore

382
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,415
And let Dragonstone,

383
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:27,465
By order of the king...

384
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:28,515
Where?

385
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,599
- ..I don't see it. - Your Majesty

386
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:33,449
He would never approve of games like that.

387
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,282
Ser Crispin, correct?

388
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,815
Sor Criston Cole.

389
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,932
Sorry. She had escaped me.

390
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:46,782
Like the day I knocked you out in the tournament?

391
00:31:49,383 --> 00:31:50,132
Great.

392
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,765
What a heartbreaking sight, Daemon

393
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:56,949
To get the king's attention, are you acting like a populin simpleton?

394
00:31:57,466 --> 00:32:01,632
I simply follow the traditions of my home, just like my brother is doing.

395
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,215
Traditions apply to real children,

396
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,115
Not for bastards born to any whore.

397
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:10,765
- Lady Mysaria is my future wife - It's despicable.

398
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:13,132
You profane your name,

399
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:14,665
Your house and the king.

400
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,782
Love ignores titles and traditions.

401
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,665
And you men of the Guard

402
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,749
You are helping a traitor

403
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,099
The king appointed me commander, my golden robes are faithful to me.

404
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:28,982
You came for the egg.

405
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:31,582
Here it is.

406
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,465
You are crazy?

407
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:36,299
You will never survive rebelling like this.

408
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:37,865
Neither you.

409
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:39,965
Choose violence,

410
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:42,015
It would be to declare war

411
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:43,315
To your king.

412
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:44,615
It is wonderful.

413
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,982
Even if you are the recipient of losing your unborn child and mother?

414
00:33:26,216 --> 00:33:26,732
Guards!

415
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:29,349
Set the blades aside.

416
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,515
- What are you doing? - I avoid a bloodbath.

417
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:40,115
Ser Criston, bring the princess to safety.

418
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,215
Don't panic Syrax.

419
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:44,799
He fiercely protects me.

420
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,500
{\an8}My father made me princess of Dragon Stone.

421
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,400
{\an8}It is my castle that you occupy my uncle.

422
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,600
{\an8}It will be yours when you come of age.

423
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,200
{\an8}You upset your king.

424
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,200
{\an8}And how did I annoy him?

425
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
{\an8}Today I celebrate my wedding.

426
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,200
{\an8}You already have a wife.

427
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,900
{\an8}That I didn't choose.

428
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,600
{\an8}And that's why you had to steal my brother's egg?

429
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,900
{\an8}A dragon shared its cradle.

430
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,400
{\an8}It will be the same for my son.

431
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,100
{\an8}Will you be a father?

432
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,000
{\an8}One day.

433
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,049
Here I am in front of you, uncle.

434
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,215
The object of your wrath.

435
00:35:39,733 --> 00:35:42,332
The reason for your disinheritance.

436
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:46,449
If you want to be the heir, you'll have to kill me.

437
00:35:47,483 --> 00:35:49,032
So do it.

438
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:52,149
Put an end to these inconveniences.

439
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,899
You announced our marriage

440
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,432
Tomorrow.

441
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,282
And I was expecting a baby

442
00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:51,332
Your baby.

443
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,365
When we get married, that can happen.

444
00:37:54,616 --> 00:37:58,215
I did what it took to never have to give birth.

445
00:37:58,483 --> 00:38:01,065
Well, kids are annoying.

446
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:03,649
You swore to protect me.

447
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:07,315
Dragonstone is a safe place.

448
00:38:09,883 --> 00:38:13,732
Until the king claims the seat of his ancestors.

449
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:16,832
Your men will not kill the prince,

450
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:20,699
But what will they do with the whore he says he married

451
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,732
And who is pregnant?

452
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:23,515
Nobody will touch you.

453
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:28,365
I've been sold numerous times.

454
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,949
Since my birth.. in a land I forgot.

455
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,565
I lived most of my days in terror.

456
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,132
You are safe with me.

457
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,432
You are a Targaryen.

458
00:38:40,683 --> 00:38:44,015
You can have fun teasing the king.

459
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,565
But I do not.

460
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,415
I'm not with you for the gold,

461
00:38:49,683 --> 00:38:50,982
For your power,

462
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,549
or the color of your hair.

463
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,682
I just wanted to be released.

464
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:56,982
released?

465
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,182
Of what?

466
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:03,732
From fear.

467
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:31,382
Please, Lorde Lyonel.

468
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,699
I seek an honest opinion.

469
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:42,049
I wouldn't be able to do anything else.

470
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:45,665
Since my name was spoken at the Great Council,

471
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:49,549
I feel Corlys Velaryon's envious gaze on me,

472
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,582
Across the black waters

473
00:39:52,366 --> 00:39:55,182
You are the highest rank in the kingdom.

474
00:39:55,716 --> 00:39:57,799
The envious I can see what they want.

475
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,499
Laena Velaryon.

476
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:07,615
Lord Corlys is the commander of your ship.

477
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,449
Laena is the oldest in the richest house

478
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:11,749
Of Kingdom.

479
00:40:12,016 --> 00:40:15,382
He comes from impeccable Valyrian stock.

480
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,965
And he has Targaryen blood.

481
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,765
What would be the problem?

482
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:21,049
She is only 12 years old.

483
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,582
But it will grow.

484
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,415
I don't want to get married again.

485
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,565
As king, some things need to be done.

486
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:32,349
Like it or not.

487
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,149
You will not escape marriage.

488
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,732
And if I refuse your proposal

489
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,332
He can take it wrong.

490
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:44,899
Apart from a direct link to the throne, nothing will satisfy you.

491
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:50,015
Keep in mind the shadow of war hanging over the Stepstones.

492
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,599
The Sea Serpent owns half of our fleet.

493
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,699
He would not deprive the kingdom of his support.

494
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,265
- Who is he to deceive me? - Nobody.

495
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:06,649
However, Lamarck is a better ally than an enemy.

496
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:10,749
Corlys' gesture is calculated and natural

497
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:12,299
For a man of his position.

498
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:18,182
- You want an honest opinion... - Yes.

499
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:21,265
Marry Laena Velaryon, Your Grace.

500
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:25,632
Heed Lord Corlys' request and secure his support.

501
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,182
Once and for all.

502
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,382
Your grace.

503
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,199
The princess has returned from Dragonstone.

504
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,249
From Dragonstone?

505
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:58,299
Your grace.

506
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:03,949
You disobeyed me.

507
00:42:04,466 --> 00:42:07,765
You fled Port-Réal without saying a word.

508
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,799
and you acted

509
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,832
Without the king's permission.

510
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,715
You are my only heir.

511
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:20,065
You could have been killed!

512
00:42:23,383 --> 00:42:24,549
Can I seat?

513
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,932
You went to Dragonstone.

514
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,949
I took the egg without violence.

515
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:45,832
A feat Ser Otto could not have accomplished alone.

516
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:49,899
Yup. eh well...

517
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:57,065
I forget how much you look like her.

518
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,615
your mother's absence

519
00:43:09,116 --> 00:43:11,415
It's a wound that will never heal.

520
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:13,982
Without her,

521
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,332
The Red Keep has lost a warmth it will never regain.

522
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:22,132
Glad to hear that from you.

523
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,782
And knowing that my grief is shared.

524
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:33,615
I wish I could have comforted you better after his death.

525
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,732
I had a hard time conceiving that my daughter was becoming a woman.

526
00:43:43,816 --> 00:43:45,115
But I know

527
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,915
who understands

528
00:43:47,183 --> 00:43:49,215
What is expected of me.

529
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:51,515
The king must take a wife.

530
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:58,882
I can never replace your mother.

531
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:02,982
And I will not change my line of succession.

532
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:08,615
But you are my only heir and our line of succession is fragile.

533
00:44:08,866 --> 00:44:09,882
It can be broken easily.

534
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:14,415
By remarrying, I will be able to secure our protection.

535
00:44:14,733 --> 00:44:15,732
Against who?

536
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,799
Who wants to challenge us.

537
00:44:24,466 --> 00:44:27,015
I don't want to break our union.

538
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:28,815
You are the king.

539
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,932
Your supreme duty is to the kingdom.

540
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:38,065
Mom would understand.

541
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,132
Just as I understand.

542
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,982
hello, gentlemen

543
00:45:39,816 --> 00:45:42,915
I decided to take a new wife.

544
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:02,332
I'm getting married...

545
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,632
com Lady Alicent Hightower,

546
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:14,265
Until late spring.

547
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,415
But it doesn't make any sense.

548
00:46:23,733 --> 00:46:26,599
My house is of Valyrian descent.

549
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,699
The most powerful in the kingdom.

550
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:31,299
And I am your king.

551
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:56,582
Rhaenyra.

552
00:47:18,216 --> 00:47:21,615
House Velaryon originated in the times of ancient Valyria.

553
00:47:23,433 --> 00:47:26,265
It is older than House Targaryen,

554
00:47:27,816 --> 00:47:29,649
According to some writings.

555
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:33,015
Unlike the Targaryens,

556
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,615
We were not dragon lords.

557
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:40,849
For centuries, my house drew its sustenance from the sea.

558
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,682
With tenacity and luck.

559
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:48,132
When I ascended the throne of Driftwood,

560
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:50,999
I knew what I wanted.

561
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,899
Then I understood.

562
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,015
Unlike other gentlemen,

563
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:02,715
I built my throne with sweat on my forehead.

564
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,332
I always thought that you and me

565
00:48:11,616 --> 00:48:13,432
We were made of the same fabric.

566
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,582
I didn't know your brother was king.

567
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:28,199
We both have to chart our destinies.

568
00:48:28,933 --> 00:48:32,099
We have been ignored far too often.

569
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:37,849
Did you take me to Driftmark to remind me of my post?

570
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,182
Or is there another reason?

571
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,615
A conflict shakes the Steps.

572
00:48:48,483 --> 00:48:49,549
A Myrien prince

573
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,399
He feeds the sailors crabs.

574
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:56,782
I asked the king to send my fleet to this area.

575
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,099
But he refused.

576
00:48:59,366 --> 00:49:01,165
It was never your forte.

577
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:02,749
Thing?

578
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,132
be king.

579
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,649
nutrigranchi has the support of the Free Cities

580
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,965
who would love to see Westeros weakened.

581
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:20,699
The king's lack of attention allowed him to gain strength.

582
00:49:22,516 --> 00:49:24,899
If we lose these sea lanes,

583
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,199
My house will be shaken.

584
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:31,099
Driftmark won't fall while the king warms up

585
00:49:31,366 --> 00:49:33,715
At feasts, dances and tournaments.

586
00:49:33,983 --> 00:49:36,565
I'll talk to my brother whenever and however I want.

587
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:39,715
You are not going.

588
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,999
An attack on the Steps would allow you to

589
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:49,365
to prove its worth to those who doubt it.

590
00:49:51,183 --> 00:49:53,799
We are the eldest children in the kingdom.

591
00:49:55,100 --> 00:50:01,199
Our value is not taken for granted, it must be created.
